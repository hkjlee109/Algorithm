In chess, queens can move any number of squares vertically, horizontally, or
diagonally. The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n Ã— n
chessboard so that no two queens can attack each other.

Given an integer n, print all possible distinct solutions to the n-queens
puzzle. Each solution contains distinct board configurations of the placement
of the n queens, where the solutions are arrays that contain permutations of
[1, 2, 3, .. n]. The number in the ith position of the results array indicates
that the ith column queen is placed in the row with that number.
